# FIA WEC Driver Ratings Analysis

### Final project for IronHack Data Analytics Bootcamp Course

This project is centered around an analysis of data from the FIA World Endurance Championship to predict the driver rating of each driver. The project will use multiple machine learning techniques, and several python libraries.

### The dataset

The original dataset is found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tristenterracciano/fia-wec-lap-data-20122022) and includes lap by lap data for WEC races from the series inception in 2012 to mid-2022 season. The data made available on Kaggle originally comes from [the official WEC results portal](http://fiawec.alkamelsystems.com/) where .csv files can be downloaded for all events and session that have taken place.
