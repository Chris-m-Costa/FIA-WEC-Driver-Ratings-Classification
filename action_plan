***Scrape full driver lists and set a value for FIA precious metals ratings

***Add a new calculated column showing the rolling 5-lap average for each driver
	If the driver has not yet done 5 consecutive laps in a stint show average of the completed laps
	for the first lap of a stint would simply report laptime.
		to match original datset avg_5 data should be stored in both '01:33.270' format and raw seconds '93.270' format
		ML will only use raw seconds format, full format is kepped for other analysis
	


***Predict a drivers fia metal rating based on available dataset/cluster drivers based on available data
	Assess and grade the performabnce of the precious metals rating system
		do the ratings do an effective job of grouping drivers based on pace/performance
			
	Track the progression of key drivers throught the ranks
		Has anyone climbed from Bronze to Platinum (surely not) or Gold?

	What is the better arangement of a pro-am line-up?
		B,B,G?
		B,S,S?
		Other options allowed?

*** Examine safety car/FCY strategies

*** What most determines a winner 
	Fastest possible speed vs most consistent pace vs time spent in pits
	
	
*** Driver pace drop-off/variance over multiple stints, over consecutive stints, pro vs am differences
	Try to account for other factors like time of day, close battle.

*** How close is the racing? What class has the most close racing.
	How many on track passes for position per class?
		How has that changed overtime?
		Difference in LMP2 generations?

*** SQL Analysis for general stats...
